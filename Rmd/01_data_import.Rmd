## Setup & input data

```{r data_import_1}
# Load counts (featureCounts / SALMON / scRNA_pseudobulk) and harmonize with metadata
loaded <- load_counts_and_align(
    data_origin     = data_origin,
    count_path      = countFilePath,
    coldata         = coldata,
    t2g_path        = t2gPath,
    gene_name       = gene_name,
    outdir          = outdir
)

countdata <- loaded$countdata
coldata   <- loaded$coldata # possibly filtered/reordered
design    <- loaded$design

# Quick previews
datatable(coldata, caption = "Samplesheet", extensions = "FixedColumns", options = dt_opts_wide())

# Save starting environment (as in your original)
save(list = ls(all.names = TRUE), file = file.path(outdir, "start_environment.RData"))
```

#### The formula used to model gene expression in this analysis is: "`r format(formula)`".
